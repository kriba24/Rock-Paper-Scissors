# Rock Paper Scissors

___
This Python script plays a game of "Rock Paper Scissors" with the user.
It asks the user for input, then picks a random number which corresponds to picking
rock, paper, or scissors. I was inspired to do this by a similar project in my Comp Sci class in Snap, then thought about doing it in Python.
